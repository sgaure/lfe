	https://support.rstudio.com/hc/communities/public/questions/203128307-R-studio-crashes-when-executing-some-regressions
	One crash-report I've traced to a bug in R for windows (fixed in 3.2-devel), none of my
	code involved.

Mar 12, 2015.  2.1-1642 -- Silly protection bug with data.frame input to demeanlist fixed.
	It's fortunately not documented that data.frames can be used directly, neither
	is it tested.

Mar  5, 2015.  2.1.1629 -- On CRAN. (previous version broke package statar)

Feb 17, 2015.  2.0-1596 -- Bootstrap IV-CIs in condfstat()

Feb 10, 2015.  2.0-1570 -- On CRAN.

Jan 29, 2015.  2.0-1471 -- Added support for multiple left hand sides.
	** DEPRECATED iv and clustervar args to felm(). Still works with warning.
	** CHANGED 1st stage IV. to multiple lhs. $step1 is deprecated, $stage1 is a single
	   'felm' object with multiple left hand sides.
	   Some other changes to the content of a felm-object when doing IV.

Jan 27, 2015.  1.9-1457 -- Replaced ivtest() with a more general waldtest()

Jan 16, 2015.  1.9-1445 -- Added ivtest() to test endogenous variables for joint significance.
	Added cluster-support to fevcov/bccorr, currently only for the diagonal.

Dec 25, 2014.  1.8-1441 -- On CRAN.

Dec 25, 2014.  1.8-1440 -- Added fevcov() and varvars(). Discovered error in the
	handling of mutexes on Windows. Race condition. Fixed.  Rewritten
	handling of the extra IV-variables. Didn't work properly before,
	see Gomez on Oct 8 below.

Dec 15, 2014.  1.7-1412 -- Put bccorr() back in.

Oct 9, 2014.   1.7-1402 -- On CRAN. bccorr() not public for now.

	Simon Schillebeeckx <s.schillebeeckx11@imperial.ac.uk>

	effects (bccorr()).  Some bugfixes.  Not public yet.

Mar 9, 2014.   1.7-1286 -- On CRAN.

Mar 5, 2014.   1.7 -- Depend on Matrix >= 1.1-2 to ensure that exactDOF='rM' works.
     Also import xtable and Formula.  Suggest stargazer.

Feb 12, 2014.  1.7 -- Give warnings for unnamed 'clustervar' and 'iv'
     args, in preparation for moving them out of the argument list.

Feb 11, 2014.  1.7 -- Support for multi part formulas.  G() removed from documentation.

Feb 3, 2014.   1.7 -- Do multiway clustering bootstrap also.

Jan 29, 2014.  1.7 -- Support multiway clustering (Cameron, Gelbach,
     Miller). Suggested by Thiemo Fetzer.

Jan 23, 2014.  1.6-1188 -- On CRAN. Map G() to factor(), not
     as.factor(), so as to remove unused levels which otherwise will
     mess up the computation of DOF.

Jan 4, 2014.  1.6-1180 -- On CRAN.

Dec 17, 2013. 1.6 -- Fixed a bug in computing F-test for IV. Added
     F-test in 1st stage for omitted i.v.  Suppress F-test writing for
     robust and clustered errors. I can't compute it.

Dec 06, 2013. 1.6-1163 -- On CRAN.

Nov 29, 2013. 1.6 -- Support for G(x:f) with x matrix.
     Fixed a one-off error in df for the one-factor case.
     Several bug-fixes and memory optimization pertaining to large model matrices.
     Some of them in R.

Nov 25, 2013. 1.6 -- Matrix::rankMatrix bug has been fixed. We can
     use the sparse method qrLINPACK as soon as a new version of
     Matrix is released.  Bug #5031:
     https://r-forge.r-project.org/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=5031&group_id=61&atid=294
     Added contrasts-argument to felm. It applies to factors outside
     G().  Fixed efactory() for G(x:f) interactions.

Nov 14, 2013. 1.6 -- Added G(x:f) syntax for estimation similar to
     x:f, i.e. interaction between a covariate and a factor. felm()
     and getfe() are ok, but efactory() does not always produce
     estimable functions.

Nov 12, 2013. 1.5-1118 -- On CRAN. Fixed a bug which prevented bootstrapping in some cases.

Oct 28, 2013. 1.5-1107 -- On CRAN. Version presented in R journal article.
