#' Overview. Linear Group Fixed Effects
#'
#' The package uses the Method of Alternating Projections to estimate linear
#' models with multiple group fixed effects.  A generalization of the within
#' estimator. It supports IV-estimation with multiple endogenous variables via
#' 2SLS, with conditional F statistics for detection of weak instruments. It is
#' thread-parallelized and intended for large problems. A method for correcting
#' limited mobility bias is also included.
#'
#'
#' This package is intended for linear models with multiple group fixed
#' effects, i.e. with 2 or more factors with a large number of levels.  It
#' performs similar functions as [stats::lm()], but it uses a special
#' method for projecting out multiple group fixed effects from the normal
#' equations, hence it is faster. It is a generalization of the within
#' estimator.  This may be required if the groups have high cardinality (many
#' levels), resulting in tens or hundreds of thousands of dummy variables.  It
#' is also useful if one only wants to control for the group effects, without
#' actually estimating them.  The package may optionally compute standard
#' errors for the group effects by bootstrapping, but this is a very time- and
#' memory-consuming process compared to finding the point estimates.  If you
#' only have a single huge factor, the package \pkg{plm} is probably better
#' suited.  If your factors don't have thousands of levels,
#' [stats::lm()] or other packages are probably better suited.
#' \pkg{lfe} is designed to produce the same results as [stats::lm()]
#' will do if run with the full set of dummies.
#'
#' Projecting out interactions between continuous covariates and factors is
#' supported. I.e. individual slopes, not only individual intercepts. Multiple
#' left hand sides are supported.
#'
#' The package does not support non-linear models. For GLMs with many dummies there
#' is a package \pkg{alpaca} which uses similar methods to project them out.
#'
#' The estimation is done in two steps.  First the other coefficients are
#' estimated with the function [felm()] by centering on all the group
#' means, followed by an OLS (similar to lm).  Then the group effects are
#' extracted (if needed) with the function [getfe()].  This method is
#' described by \cite{Gaure (2013)}, but also appears in \cite{Guimaraes and
#' Portugal (2010)}, disguised as the Gauss-Seidel algorithm.
#'
#' There's also a function [demeanlist()] which just does the
#' centering on an arbitrary matrix or data frame, and there's a function
#' [compfactor()] which computes the connected components which are
#' used for interpreting the group effects when there are only two factors (see
#' the Abowd et al references), they are also returned by [getfe()].
#'
#' For those who study the correlation between the fixed effects, like in
#' \cite{Abowd et al. (1999)}, there are functions [bccorr()] and
#' [fevcov()] for computing limited mobility bias corrected
#' correlations and variances with the method described in \cite{Gaure
#' (2014b)}.
#'
#' Instrumental variable estimations are supported with 2SLS. Conditional F
#' statistics for testing reduced rank weak instruments as in \cite{Sanderson
#' and Windmeijer (2015)} are available in [condfstat()].  Joint
#' significance testing of coefficients is available in [waldtest()].
#'
#' The centering on the means is done with a tolerance which is set by
#' `options(lfe.eps=1e-8)` (the default).  This is a somewhat conservative
#' tolerance, in many cases I'd guess `1e-6` may be sufficient.  This may
#' speed up the centering.  In the other direction, setting
#' `options(lfe.eps=0)` will provide maximum accuracy at the cost of
#' computing time and warnings about convergence failure.
#'
#' The package is threaded, that is, it may use more than one cpu.  The number
#' of threads is fetched upon loading the package from the environment variable
#' \env{LFE_THREADS}, \env{OMP_THREAD_LIMIT}, \env{OMP_NUM_THREADS} or
#' \env{NUMBER_OF_PROCESSORS} (for Windows), and stored by
#' `options(lfe.threads=n)`.  This option can be changed prior to calling
#' [felm()], if so desired.  Note that, typically, \pkg{lfe} is
#' limited by memory bandwidth, not cpu speed, thus fast memory and large cache
#' is more important than clock frequency. It is therefore also not always true
#' that running on all available cores is much better than running on half of
#' them.
#'
#' Threading is only done for the centering; the extraction of the group
#' effects is not threaded. The default method for extracting the group
#' coefficients is the iterative Kaczmarz-method, its tolerance is also the
#' `lfe.eps` option. For some datasets the Kaczmarz-method is converging
#' very slowly, in this case it may be replaced with a conjugate gradient
#' method by setting the option `options(lfe.usecg=TRUE)`. Various
#' time-consuming parts of \pkg{lfe} may print progress reports, the minimum
#' interval in seconds is `options(lfe.pint=1800)`.
#'
#' The package has been tested on datasets with approx 20,000,000 observations
#' with 15 covariates and approx 2,300,000 and 270,000 group levels (the
#' [felm()] took about 50 minutes on 8 cpus, the [getfe()]
#' takes 5 minutes).  Though, beware that not only the size of the dataset
#' matters, but also its structure, as demonstrated by \cite{Gaure (2014a)}.
#'
#' The package will work with any number of grouping factors, but if more than
#' two, their interpretation is in general not well understood, i.e. one should
#' make sure that the group coefficients are estimable. A discussion of
#' estimability, the algorithm used, and convergence rate are available in
#' vignettes, as well as in the published papers in the citation list
#' (`citation('lfe')`).
#'
#' In the exec-directory there is a perl-script `lfescript` which is used
#' at the author's site for automated creation of R-scripts from a simple
#' specification file.  The format is documented in `doc/lfeguide.txt`.
#'
#' \pkg{lfe} is similar in function, though not in method, to the Stata modules
#' `a2reg` and `felsdvreg`.  The method is very similar to the one in
#' the Stata module `reghdfe`.
